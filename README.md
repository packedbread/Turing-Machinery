# Turing machinery
## Description
This is simple turing machine package. There are some machine implementations:

- copy machine - that copies given input in following way: 'input-text' becomes 'input-text input-text'

This list will extend upon implementation of additional procedures and functions.

Feel free to contribute and add your own implementation.

###Functions wishlist
You can submit functions, procedures or algorithms, which you would like to see implemented. The current list is:

- busy beaver game, fixed size
- busy beaver game, variable size
- RAM
- Tape marks reader and writer
- Other turing machine executor, basically simple procedure call

## Tests
You can run implementation tests with the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest turing_machine.implementations.ut
```

Additional tests are always welcome.
